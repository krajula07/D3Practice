				The Open Transport Map displays a road network which is suitable for routing,
	which visualizes average daily Traffic Volumes for the whole EU ,
	visualizes daytime related Traffic Volumes in OTN Pilot Citiesâ€“
	(Antwerp, Birmingham, Issy-le-Moulineaux, Liberec region)
			</p>
			<p>

	Talking technical, the Open Transport Map can serve as a map itself as well as a layer embedded in your map ,is derived from the most popular open dataset - OpenStreetMap ,
	 is accessible via both GUI and API and covers the whole European Union
			</p>

			<p>
				With this developing technologies without maps its really difficult to go on with a day.We need maps to go to one place to another on daily basis .So ,I always find maps as an interesting and an intelligent visualisation system till now.
			</p>
			<p>
				User can always find the city of which he is travelling and look into the volume of traffic and can get deroute information,if one way is blocked or with any issue on that road, for the whole European Union.
